            <p>Originally from Chicago, I moved across the country to Seattle in 2014 and have fallen in love with the Pacific Northwest. To date my professional experience has focused on Project Management, Structural Design Engineering, and Test Engineering, with some volunteer work peppered in as a treasurer for a non-profit. When faced with the challenges brought on by the pandemic, I stumbled upon an opportunity to learn about web development and discovered a new passion. I'm now enrolled as a student with University of Washington's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp and am on a journey to a new career.</p>
            <p>Starting in March, I was just learning about HTML and CSS. Through out the program there have been many challenges and opportunities, but with those challenges, my skillset has grown substantially. Over the last 5 months I have refactored code, designed and developed front-end, back-end and full stack applications both on my own and through team collaboration. As I learn more about becoming a web developer, I'm hoping to bring my drive, passion, and prior knowledge into this new career.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, you can find me spending time outside with my husband and our dog. We love taking quick day hikes through Discovery Park in Seattle, and sailing out on the Puget Sound. Anything that gets us moving and in the sun is a plus! I'm also a big fan of Crossfit and have found a great community at the local box, Valkyrie Strength and Conditioning.</p>
